# RF Link Planner

## Overview
The RF Link Planner is a web-based tool for planning and visualizing radio frequency (RF) links. It allows users to place towers on a map, connect them to form links, and analyze the Fresnel zone clearance using elevation data.

## Key Features
- **Tower Placement**: Interactive map interface for precise tower positioning.
- **Link Analysis**: Visualization of RF links with automatic distance and Fresnel zone calculations.
- **Fresnel Zone Visualization**: Visual representation of the first Fresnel zone to identify potential terrain obstructions.
- **Elevation Profiling**: Integration with elevation APIs to retrieve terrain data for link paths.
- **Minimalist Interface**: A clean, high-contrast UI designed for clarity and ease of use.
